# ðŸ“¦  Docker compose demo

Requires a modern version of Docker and (GNU) Make.

Everything interesting lives in the `app` dir. From there, a few commands will get things going.

To create the Django app:
```sh
make setup
```

To start the system:
```sh
make start
```

To stop the system:
```sh
make stop
```
